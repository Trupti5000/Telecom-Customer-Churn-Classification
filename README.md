# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Classification

**Business Issue Overview** :-
In the telecom sector, customers can select from a range of service providers and easily switch between them, creating a highly competitive environment. 
This results in an average annual churn rate of 15-25%. With the cost of acquiring a new customer being 5-10 times higher than retaining an existing one, prioritizing customer retention has become essential, often taking precedence over acquiring new customers.

For many established telecom companies, keeping their most valuable customers is the main goal.
To reduce customer loss, these companies need to predict which customers are most likely to leave.

_**In this project, we will analyze data from a top telecom firm, create models to spot customers who are likely to churn, and find out the main reasons behind it.**_

**Exploring and Defining Customer Churn** :-
The telecom sector features two main payment models: postpaid, where customers settle a monthly or annual bill after using services, and prepaid, where customers pay or top up their accounts in advance and use the services until the balance is depleted.
In the postpaid model, when customers choose to switch to a different provider, they usually notify their current operator to terminate their services, clearly indicating that churn has occurred.
Conversely, in the prepaid model, customers can switch networks by simply ceasing their usage without notifying the provider. This makes it difficult to determine if a customer has genuinely churned or is merely taking a temporary break from the service (e.g., due to traveling abroad).
Therefore, predicting churn is especially important and challenging for prepaid customers, and it’s crucial to define ‘churn’ accurately. The prepaid model is widespread in India and Southeast Asia, while postpaid is more common in Europe and North America.

This project focuses on the Indian and Southeast Asian markets.

**What Is Churn?** 
Churn can be interpreted in several ways, such as:-

_**Usage-Based Churn:**_ This definition identifies churn as customers who have not used any services—such as making calls or using the internet—over a set period.
A potential drawback of this approach is that if a customer has been inactive for a while, it may be too late to take action to retain them. For example, if churn is defined as "no usage for two months," it could be ineffective because the customer might have already switched to another provider by then.

In this project, we will use the usage-based definition to determine churn.

_**Revenue-Based Churn:**_ This definition targets customers who haven’t used any services that generate revenue, such as mobile internet, outgoing calls, or SMS, over a specific time period. It might also include metrics like customers who generate less than INR 4 in total, average, or median revenue per month.

A key limitation of this definition is that it may overlook customers who use services without generating revenue. For example, many users in rural areas may only receive calls or SMS from family members working in cities, meaning they use the services without contributing to revenue.

_**High-Value Churn:**_ In regions like India and Southeast Asia, about 80% of revenue is generated by just the top 20% of customers, known as high-value customers. By focusing on reducing churn among these key customers, we can significantly curb revenue leakage.

In this project, we will identify high-value customers using a specific metric (to be described later) and will concentrate on predicting churn exclusively for this segment.

**Business Goals and Data Overview:- **
The dataset provides customer-level details for a four-month period: June, July, August, and September, with these months coded as 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively.
