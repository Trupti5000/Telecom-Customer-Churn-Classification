# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Classification

**Business Issue Overview** :-
In the telecom sector, customers can select from a range of service providers and easily switch between them, creating a highly competitive environment. 
This results in an average annual churn rate of 15-25%. With the cost of acquiring a new customer being 5-10 times higher than retaining an existing one, prioritizing customer retention has become essential, often taking precedence over acquiring new customers.

For many established telecom companies, keeping their most valuable customers is the main goal.
To reduce customer loss, these companies need to predict which customers are most likely to leave.

_**In this project, we will analyze data from a top telecom firm, create models to spot customers who are likely to churn, and find out the main reasons behind it.**_

**Exploring and Defining Customer Churn** :-
The telecom sector features two main payment models: postpaid, where customers settle a monthly or annual bill after using services, and prepaid, where customers pay or top up their accounts in advance and use the services until the balance is depleted.
In the postpaid model, when customers choose to switch to a different provider, they usually notify their current operator to terminate their services, clearly indicating that churn has occurred.
Conversely, in the prepaid model, customers can switch networks by simply ceasing their usage without notifying the provider. This makes it difficult to determine if a customer has genuinely churned or is merely taking a temporary break from the service (e.g., due to traveling abroad).
Therefore, predicting churn is especially important and challenging for prepaid customers, and it’s crucial to define ‘churn’ accurately. The prepaid model is widespread in India and Southeast Asia, while postpaid is more common in Europe and North America.

This project focuses on the Indian and Southeast Asian markets.
